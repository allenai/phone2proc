This repository contains the code for [Phone2Proc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04819). It performs conditional procedural generation to build a dataset of houses based on a specified [RoomPlan USDZ file](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/roomplan/). The backend uses AI2-THOR and ProcTHOR. The generated houses are in the ProcTHOR house JSON format (see [this tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Il6TqmRXOkzYMIEaOU9e4-uTDTIb5Q78) on loading them into ProcTHOR). 

To obtain RoomPlan USDZ files, you'll need to load a custom app onto your phone, scan your scene, and then export it to a USDZ.

See the [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgqwrgNiA68) and the [RoomPlan tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/roomplan/create_a_3d_model_of_an_interior_room_by_guiding_the_user_through_an_ar_experience) for more help.

To build the houses, use:

```bash
python3 dmain_wrapper.py
```

It'll generate houses based on the specified RoomPlan layout. You may need to go into `main.py` and change some constants, such as which USDZ file is being used.

Note that the RoomPlan scene must have all walls form an enclosed loop. Otherwise the generation will not work as it'll be underspecified how to generate the floorplan.
